# Riyadh-Transport
Welcome to this in development program, this program is still in it's early stages of development, here's our development plan:

✅ Build a prototype with a basic non-real map in Python
✅ Expand the code to real world examples
🛠️ Add all the busses to the python code
🛠️ Develop a QT adaptation
❌ Develop a GUI
❌ Port to mobile platforms
❌ Release as APK on Android
❌ Deploy on Testflght for iOS
❌ Official full release publicly

## Abilities and Limitations
The program can:
 - Give navigational instructions
 - Calculate routes using smart algorithms
 - Offer 2 routes, fastest and least transfers
 - Count the necessary stations crossed


The program **CANNOT** so far:
 - Show you the route on a map
 - Tell you to walk from 1 station to another
 - Use GPS
 - Know the closest station to you
 - Tell you when the bus comes
 - Pay for your busses
 - Tell you the price
