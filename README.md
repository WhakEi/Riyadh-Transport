# Riyadh-Transport
Welcome to this in development program, this program is still in it's early stages of development, here's our development plan:

 - ‚úÖ Build a prototype with a basic non-real map in Python
 - ‚úÖ Expand the code to real world examples
 - ‚úÖ Add all the busses to the python code
 - ‚ùå ~~Develop a QT adaptation~~ **(SCRAPPED)**
 - üõ†Ô∏è Implement integrations with mapping software
 - üõ†Ô∏è Develop a GUI
 - ‚ùå Port to mobile platforms
 - ‚ùå Use location proximity to find nearest station
 - ‚ùå Release as APK on Android
 - ‚ùå Deploy on Testflight for iOS
 - ‚ùå Official full release publicly

## Changelog
Alpha Version 0.16
 - ALL THE BUSSES ARE NOW AVAILABLE
 - Experimenting with neighboring stations and walking instructions
 - Added Station Information tab (Not working yet)
 - Added Disclaimer tab
 - Updated calculation algorithm
 - Starting transition to user-friendly GUI

## How to run
1. On Windows open Powershell, on Linux open Terminal and do `pip install tkinter pillow eel`
2. Make sure you have a chromium browser installed, such as Google Chrome or Chromium
3. Run the main script by doing `python ruhbuspt.py`

## Abilities and Limitations
The program can:
 - Give navigational instructions
 - Calculate routes using smart algorithms
 - Offer 2 routes, fastest and least transfers
 - Count the necessary stations crossed
 - Show you the route on a map


The program **CANNOT** so far:
 - Tell you to walk from 1 station to another
 - Use GPS
 - Know the closest station to you
 - Tell you when the bus comes
 - Pay for your busses
 - Tell you the price
